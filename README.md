# üêà Personal Git Config

Just my personal `~/.gitconfig` file used as my daily drive. Some aliases include:
- `listconfig`: List my config
- `lb`: Display the 10 most recently worked on branches ([credit to this blog](https://ses4j.github.io/2020/04/01/git-alias-recent-branches/))
- `st`: A non-verbose status
- `structure`: Display the tree structure of the repository ([credit to this blog](https://www.eficode.com/blog/10-levels-of-git-aliases-beginner-to-intermediate-concepts))
- `s20`: The same as the `structure`, but it will display the last 10 in a non-pagenated way (I hate pressing q to exit)
- `slog`: Will display the log in a pretty format ([credit to this blog](https://www.eficode.com/blog/10-levels-of-git-aliases-beginner-to-intermediate-concepts))
- `last` and `l20` is the same as `slog`, but varies in the number of logs
- `acommit`: Commit Anonymously. Usage: `git acommit -m "my little secret` ([credit to this blog](https://www.eficode.com/blog/10-levels-of-git-aliases-beginner-to-intermediate-concepts))
- `uncommit`: A little nod to my most frequently visited [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19859486/how-to-un-commit-last-un-pushed-git-commit-without-losing-the-changes)
- `nb`: Creates a new branch based on the current branch and publishes it
- `nbm`: Creates a new branch based on "main" and publishes it
- `latest-tag`: Gets the latest tag in the repo based on semantic versioning
- `tag10`: Gets the latest 10 tags based on the created date
